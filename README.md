# React Rocket

A React Boilerplate Starter. Simple, fast and elegant.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### What is included

This boilerplate assumes the project will be built using these technologies:

* React.js
* Yarn as Package Manager (easily modified to npm if that is your choice)
* SCSS for styling
* Webpack as an asset bundler
* Babel as JS Compiler

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

The first step is to clone the repository. Forking it is a better idea if you want to contribute, but let us do it the easy way. First, clone the repository to your local hard drive. Assuming you are in a place where you want the project to be stored, run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/strudra/react-rocket && cd react-rocket
```

This will take a while until the repository is downloaded. The other part of the command makes sure you are in the project directory. Then, install the dependencies using

```
yarn install # or npm install
```

Finally, run the local server (using dev-server) with

```
yarn run dev-server
```

## Testing

Testing is planned to be implemented in v2.0. Please contribute if you want.

### Coding style

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

This project uses JS Standard. Please configure your editor to show you things you need to fix. Also, test cases regarding style should be implemented. If you want StandardJS to automatically fix your style (assuming you installed the dependency), run

```
standard --fix
```
